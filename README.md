# maml

A Python implementation MAML (model-agnostic meta learning) using only Numpy and simple 1-layer network. Just for better understanding of MAML.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Logging

All are included in Anaconda.

## Usage

Just run `maml.py`, that's all. This implements a binary classification problem. However, I noticed that the results of MAML are not so encouraging. A better deeper model will do good.
